# Servers<a name="discovered_servers"></a>

The **Servers** page provides system configuration and performance data about each server instance known to the data discovery tools\. You can group servers into logical units called applications, which represent higher\-level solutions that need to be migrated jointly to remain functional\. You can also apply custom tags to servers to assist in your migration planning\.

On this page, you can: 

+ View and search server information

+ Tag multiple servers

+ Tag a single server

+ Remove tags from multiple servers

+ Remove tags from a single server

+ Export data about a server

The following procedures describe how to carry out typical server\-related management tasks\.

**To view and search server information**

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Servers**\. 

1. To filter the display, choose the menu\-driven filter bar, and select one of the available fields in the resulting menu:

   + **Server ID**—Server configuration item identifier generated by Application Discovery Service to uniquely identify a server\.

   + **Host name**—Host name of the server\.

   + **OS name**—Operating system name\.

   + **OS version**—Operating system version\.

   + **Agent ID**—Identifier for agent that collected server data\.

   + **Connector ID**—Identifier of the connector that collected the server data\.

   + **Type**—Server type\.

   + **VMware more ID**—VMware VM Managed Object Reference \(MoRef\) ID\.

   + **VMware vCenter ID**—Identifier for the vCenter\.

   + **VMware host system ID**—Identifier for the host system\.

   + **IP address**—IP address of the server\.

   + **MAC address**—Mac address of the server\.

   + **Avg CPU usage %**—Average CPU usage percentage\.

   + **Total disk free size \(KB\)**—Total disk free size in KB\.

   + **Avg free RAM \(KB\)**—Total disk free size in KB\.

   + **Tag value**—Configuration tag value\.

   + **Tag key**—Configuration tag key\.

   + **Application name**—Name of application to which the server belongs\.

   + **Application description**—Description of application to which the server belongs\.

   + **Application ID**—Unique identifier of Application configuration item to which the server belongs\.

1. Select one of the available operators:

   + **==**

   + **\!=**

   + **Contains**

   + **Not Contains**

1. Supply a value or choose from values offered by the menu\. These vary based on the filter that you selected earlier\. For **Type**, you see a menu with values such as the following:

   + **EC2**

   + **OTHER**

   + **VMWARE\_VM**

   + **VMWARE\_HOST**

   + **VMWARE\_VM\_TEMPLATE**

   The table now displays only the entries that match your filter criterion\. You can also define multiple filters, delete filters, and bypass the filter menus by typing into the filter bar directly\.

1. In the table, choose a **Server ID** link to display details about that server\. This opens a details page with basic system information, system performance, and the status of recent export jobs\. Under the server name at the top of the page, the console displays applications and tags associated with the server\. Choose **Actions** to see the actions that can be performed on the server, including **Group as application**, **Add tag**, **Remove server from application**, **Remove tag**, and **Export server details**\.

Tags are user\-defined key/value pairs that can store meta\-information about servers\. Application discovery tags are similar to AWS tags, but the two types of tag cannot be used interchangeably\. You can add or remove tags on up to 10 servers at a time on the **Servers** page\. On server details pages, you can add or remove tags only for the selected server\. Up to five tags can be added or removed from a server or servers in a single operation\.

**To tag multiple servers**

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Servers**\.

1. In the table, select the check boxes of the servers to tag and choose **Add tag**\.

1. In the **Add Tags** window, provide a key \(tag name\) and a value\. 

1. To add additional tags to the selected servers, choose **Additional tag** and repeat the previous step\.

1. Choose **Save**\. Note that table entries for the tagged servers now display the new tag keys in the **Tags** field\.

1. Open the **Server ID** link of a newly tagged server\. On the details page, note that the **Tags** list near the top of the page displays the new tag keys\. 

1. Choose the tag key names\. The **Tags** window opens with a table containing all of the tag key/value pairs for the selected server\.

**To tag a single server**

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Servers**\.

1. In the table of servers, select a server ID to open the server details page\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Add tag**\.

1. In the **Add Tags** window, provide a key \(tag name\) and a value\. 

1. To add additional tags to the selected server, choose **Additional tag** and repeat the previous step\.

1. Choose **Save**\. On the details page, note that the **Tags** list near the top of the page displays the new tag keys\.

**To remove tags from multiple servers**

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Servers**\.

1. In the table of servers, select the check boxes of the servers sharing a tag to remove\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Remove tag**\.

1. In the **Remove Tags** window, enter the key/value pair of the tag to remove\. 

1. To remove additional tags from the selected servers, choose **Additional tag** and repeat the previous step\.

1. Choose **Remove** to delete the tags from the selected servers\. Note that table entries for the selected servers no longer display keys for removed tags\. 

**To remove tags from a single server**

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Servers**\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Remove tag**\.

1. In the **Remove Tags** window, select the check boxes of key/value pairs to remove\. 

1. To remove additional tags from the selected server, choose **Additional tag** and repeat the previous step\.

1. Choose **Save**\. On the details page, note that the **Tags** list near the top of the page no longer displays keys for removed tags\.

**To export data about a server**

Application Discovery Service supports up to five concurrent exports of server data\. Start export jobs as described in the following procedure\.

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Servers**\.

1. Choose the **Server ID** of a server\. This opens a details page that displays information about the server's hardware, operating system, and performance\.

1. The **Exports** section of the details page displays a table of export jobs \(if any\) for the server\. Information includes:

   + **Export ID**—A unique ID for the export job

   + **From date/time**—Starting date and time of the data sample period

   + **To date/time**—Ending date and time of the data sample period

   + **Export status**—Possible values are **In\-progress** and **Completed**

   + **Export requested time**—Date and time of the export request

   + A link to the exported data \(in zip format\) stored in your AWS account's S3 bucket

   To request a new export, choose **Export server details**\.

1. In the **Export server details** window, provide the starting date and time and ending date and time in the format indicated\. Note that the time period cannot be greater than 72 hours, and it cannot be in the future\. 

1. Choose **Export** to start the job\. The initial status will be **In\-progress**; to update the status, click the refresh icon in the **Exports** section heading\.

1. When the export job is complete, choose **Download** and save the zip file\.

1. Unzip the saved file\. The exported data is contained in a set of CSV similar to the following:

   + *<AWS account ID>*\_destinationProcessConnection\.csv

   + *<AWS account ID>*\_networkInterface\.csv

   + *<AWS account ID>*\_osInfo\.csv

   + *<AWS account ID>*\_process\.csv

   + *<AWS account ID>*\_sourceProcessConnection\.csv

   + *<AWS account ID>*\_systemPerformance\.csv

   You can open the CSV files in Excel and review the exported server data\. 

   Also present is a JSON file containing data about the export task and its results\. The customer can write a script to read the JSON and manipulate the downloaded server data\.
