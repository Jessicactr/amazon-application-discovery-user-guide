# Before You Install<a name="before_you_install"></a>

Complete the following tasks before you install the AWS Application Discovery Service components\.

**Note**  
You must have an active AWS account to perform these procedures\. To create one, open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and choose **Create an AWS Account**\.

## Create an IAM User<a name="appdisc-iam-user"></a>

Services in AWS, such as Application Discovery Service, require that you provide credentials when you access them\. This allows the service to determine whether you have permissions to access its resources\. We recommend that you avoid accessing AWS with the credentials for your AWS account; instead, use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. Create an IAM user, and then add the user to an IAM group with administrative permissions and grant administrative permissions to this user\. You can then access AWS using a special URL and the credentials for the IAM user\.

For more information about setting up an IAM administrator, see [Creating Your First IAM Admin User and Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html)\. For information about IAM, see [What Is IAM?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)\.

## Attach Required IAM User Policies<a name="appdisc-user-policy"></a>

Application Discovery Service uses the following IAM managed policies to control access to the service or components of the service\. For information about how to attach managed policies to an IAM user account, see [Working with Managed Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-using.html)\. 

**Note**  
The policies described here only provide access to the Application Discovery Service\. Application Discovery Service is now integrated with the [AWS Migration Hub](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/whatishub.html)\. For access to features of the Migration Hub other than Application Discovery, you must apply additional policies\. For more information, see [Authentication and Access Control for AWS Migration Hub](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/auth-and-access-control.html)\. 

**AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFullAccess**  
Grants the IAM user account access to the Application Discovery Service API\. With this policy, the user can configure Application Discovery Service, start and stop agents, start and stop agentless discovery, and query data from the AWS Discovery Service database\. This policy also grants the user access to Arsenal\. Arsenal is an agent service managed and hosted by AWS that forwards data to Application Discovery Service in the cloud\.

**AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentAccess**  
Grants Application Discovery Agent access to register and communicate with Application Discovery Service\. This policy should be attached to any user whose credentials are to be used by Application Discovery Agent\.

**AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService**  
Grants the AWS Agentless Discovery Connector running in your VMware vCenter Server access to register, communicate with, and share connector health metrics with Application Discovery Service\. This policy must be attached to any user whose credentials are to be used by the connector\.

**Note**  
The `AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService` policy uses the following API actions: `awsconnector:RegisterConnector` and `awsconnector:GetConnectorHealth`\. For more information, see [API Actions of the AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService IAM Policy](#agentless-IAM-actions)\.

Each of the Application Discovery Service managed policies is shown here so that you can customize them as needed\.

### API Actions of the AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService IAM Policy<a name="agentless-IAM-actions"></a>

The `AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService` IAM policy uses `awsconnector:RegisterConnector` and `awsconnector:GetConnectorHealth` to grant the AWS Agentless Discovery Connector access to register, communicate with, and share connector health metrics with Application Discovery Service\.
