# View Collected Data Using the Console<a name="view-data"></a>

After starting the data collection process of your Discovery Connector or Discovery Agent, you can use the console to view their collected data about your servers and VMs\. Data appears in the console approximately 15 minutes after turning on data collection\. This data can also be viewed in a csv  format by exporting the collected data by making API calls through the AWS CLI\. Exporting collected data is covered in the next section [Export Collected Data](export-data.md)\. 

**To view collected data about discovered servers**

1. In the console's navigation pane, choose **Servers**\. The discovered servers appear in the servers list\.

1. For details comprised of the collected data, choose the server name link in the **Server info** column\. Doing so displays a screen that describes detail information such as system information, performance metrics, and more\.
